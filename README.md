# Tech-Blog_using-MVC

## Description

This project was to make a fullstack page for a tech blog.
I found this project to be challenging due to the time constraints.
But this project did teach me a decent amount about how to build a full stack application as well as how handlebars works as well as deploying to heroku with a database.
